### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Having spent several years analyzing market dynamics, conducting competition analyses, identifying trends, and evaluating sales performance solely through Excel and PowerPoint, I recognized the need to deepen my technical knowledge. Over the past few months, I dedicated myself to learning SQL, Python, delving into machine learning and deep learning, and mastering visualization tools such as Power BI and Tableau, along with exploring the data ecosystem, including Google Cloud Platform and Docker.

To immerse myself in this new world of possibilities, I enrolled in the [Data Analytics Professional Certificate from Google](https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/google-data-analytics), a 180-hour MOOC. Additionally, I completed a 10-week bootcamp with Le Wagon, sponsored by Google, focusing on [Data Science & AI](https://www.lewagon.com/fr/paris/data-science-course). I continue my learning journey daily through platforms like [DataCamp](https://www.datacamp.com/).

I am eager to apply my newly acquired skills in the business world.
